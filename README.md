## How to Fork, Clone, and Make a Pull Request

### Forking the Repository

1. Navigate to the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository's page.
3. GitHub will create a copy of the repository under your account.

### Cloning the Forked Repository

1. After forking, you'll land on your forked repository's page. Copy the URL of your forked repository. It should look like `https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
4. Use the `git clone` command followed by the URL you copied. It should look like this:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Navigate into the cloned repository using `cd repository-name`.
2. Make changes to the code or files as needed using your preferred text editor or IDE.

### Committing Changes

1. After making changes, you need to commit them to your local repository.
2. Use the following commands:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
   ```

### Pushing Changes to Your Fork

1. Once changes are committed, push them to your fork on GitHub using the following command:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

   Note: Replace `main` with the name of the branch you are working on, if different.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Visit your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull Request" button.
3. GitHub will compare the changes between your fork and the original repository.
4. Review the changes and add a description if necessary.
5. Click on the "Create Pull Request" button.
6. Congratulations! You've successfully created a pull request. Now, wait for the repository owner to review and merge your changes.

### Syncing Your Fork with the Original Repository

If there have been changes in the original repository and you want to update your fork with those changes:

1. Add the original repository as a remote upstream:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Fetch the changes from the upstream repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```

3. Merge the changes into your local repository's main branch:

   ```bash
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

4. Push the changes to your fork on GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

This will keep your fork synced with the original repository.
